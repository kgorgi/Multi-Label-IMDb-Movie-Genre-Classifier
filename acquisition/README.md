# Acquisition Module

This module is separated into four files:

- crawler.py: Retrieve a list of movies along with their genres from IMDb
- scraper.py: Scrap movie synopses from IMDb
- runner.py: Multi-threading manager
- utilities.py: Commonly used functionality

To run the acquisition module, navigate to the acquisition folder and run 'python3 runner.py'. This module requires the beautifulsoup4 be installed. 

Note: Raw data outputted by the acquisition module may be different from the raw data in the data folder because of how non-deterministic order of multi-threading processing.
